## üéì What I Learned / Project Challenges

* **Practical React Implementation:** This project solidified my understanding of React functional components and hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`) for managing application state and interacting with a map API.
* **Utility-First CSS:** I gained significant experience building responsive and custom user interfaces from scratch using **Tailwind CSS**, which dramatically sped up the UI development process.
* **Modern Frontend Tooling:** I learned to configure a modern development environment using **Vite** for a React-based project, including its seamless integration with the **Vitest** testing framework.
* **Component Testing:** I developed skills in writing unit tests for React components using **Vitest** and the **React Testing Library**, ensuring the UI is reliable and functions as expected.
